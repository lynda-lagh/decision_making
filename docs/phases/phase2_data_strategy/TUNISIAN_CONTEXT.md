**Equipment Stress Factors**:
1. **Heat stress** in summer months (June-August)
2. **Dust and sand** from Sahara winds
3. **Water scarcity** requiring efficient irrigation
4. **Intense harvest periods** (May-June for cereals)

**Maintenance Implications**:
- More frequent cooling system maintenance
- Increased air filter replacements (dust)
- Higher irrigation system usage and wear
- Heat-related failures in summer
