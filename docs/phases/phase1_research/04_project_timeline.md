## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| No real data available | Use synthetic data generation |
| Model accuracy below target | Use ensemble methods, more features |
| Timeline delays | Prioritize core features, defer nice-to-haves |
| Technical challenges | Use proven technologies, seek help early |

---
