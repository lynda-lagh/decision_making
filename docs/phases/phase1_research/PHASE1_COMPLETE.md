## 💡 Key Insights Gained

### Domain Insights

1. **Seasonality is Critical**
   - Agricultural equipment usage follows crop cycles
   - Maintenance must be scheduled during off-season
   - Harvest season downtime is extremely costly

2. **Failure Patterns are Predictable**
   - 25% of failures are engine/oil related
   - 20% are hydraulic issues
   - Most failures have warning signs

3. **Cost of Reactive Maintenance**
   - Unplanned downtime: 20-30 hours/season
   - Average cost: $15K/equipment/year
   - 55% of maintenance is still reactive

4. **Opportunity for Improvement**
   - 60-70% reduction in downtime achievable
   - 25-33% cost savings possible
   - ROI within 6-12 months

### Technical Insights

1. **Data Requirements**
   - Minimum 2 years historical data needed
   - Time series requires consistent timestamps
   - Imbalanced data (failures are rare events)

2. **Model Selection**
   - Tree-based models work well for tabular data
   - SARIMA captures seasonal patterns
   - Ensemble methods improve accuracy

3. **Feature Engineering is Key**
   - Rolling statistics capture trends
   - Lag features capture history
   - Time-based features capture seasonality

4. **Interpretability Matters**
   - Farmers need to understand predictions
   - SHAP values for feature importance
   - Confidence scores for trust
